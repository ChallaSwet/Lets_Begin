**Research:**

- The first ATM concept arose in different countries like Japan, the UK, Sweden & the US. So, Japan invented the Machine for Computer Loan that is called a computer load machine to supply cash. This device was used in the year1966.
- After some developments, the initial cash dispensing machine was developed by Britain, in London, 1967. This machine was first used by “Barclays Bank” which is located in Enfield Town of North London. This machine was developed by the firm De La Rue & John Shepherd-Barron. This was the essential point for current ATMs.
- In India, the development of ATMs was very slow because they were launched in the early 1990s to the Indians and assisted through foreign banks.
- The idea of a [PIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number) stored on the card was developed by a group of engineers working at [Smiths Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiths_Group) on the Chubb MD2 in 1965.
- After 2010, technological developments increased in ATM non-banking services. Such services include bill payments, ticket bookings, mobile recharges, etc.
