**10. Testing:**

v      Testing is the one of step in the software process that could be viewed as destructive rather than constructive.

v      Software is tested from different perspectives :

\1.   White box test.

1. Black box test

**10.1 Whitebox Test:**

v     White box tests focus on the program  control structure, internal program logic is exercised using this techniques.

**10.2 Blackbox Test:**

v     Black box testing is software requirements are exercised and derive sets of inputs conditions that will fully exercise all functional requirements for a program this testing is also called “behavioral testing”.

**10.3 Level of Testing:**

The details of software functionality & test conditions are satisfied fully on behavioral based so that choose for black box testing.

1. **Blackbox Testing**:

by incorrect or missing function

` `applying block box testing in my project “ATTM SYSTEM”

interface errors

errors in external database access behavior (or) performance error

initialization and termination error its mainly used for uncover errors in software functions

**10.3.2 Behavioral testing:**

It is possible to simulate the behavior of a real time system and consequence of external events.  In this test, we check in client side if the client enter incorrect pin number for more than “three” times the applications will be closed.

**10.3.3 System Testing:**

Software and hardware are integrated and full range of system test is conducted so that we check for interrupt priority and the performance of each interrupt handling procedures.  In this test check on each options of banking process
